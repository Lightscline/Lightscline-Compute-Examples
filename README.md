# LightsclineCompute-Demo

This repository contains demo files for Lightscline's AI software: LightsclineCompute


## Engagement Model

1. [Book a meeting here](https://calendly.com/lightscline/lightscline-ai-demo). 

2. In the initial meeting, we will:

   1. Give a product demo
   2. Identify a customer use case
   3. Set success metric(s) (e.g. accuracy, time, compute reduction)
   4. Estimate a rough business impact (e.g. Deployment time 10 Week -> 1 Week, Model Training Cost - $1 Million ->$100k)

3. After the meeting, Lightscline will either:
   * Provide the SDK for your team to test and share results over 2 weeks, or
   * Analyze your data and deliver a report based on the success metrics within 2 weeks. 
    
    If your team choose to play with the SDK yourself, The following 2 files can help you get started:

    `Single Channel.ipynb` -  contains a example with one channel of sensor data

    `Multi Channel, Multi Modal.ipynb` - contains a example with multiple channels (multiple modality) of data. 



4. If successful, we will proceed to the next phase.
